In the **PermissionsGuideCompose** project, I gained a solid understanding of handling Android permissions within a Jetpack Compose environment. This project provided me with hands-on experience in:

- **Requesting Permissions**: I learned how to effectively request and manage runtime permissions using Jetpack Compose.
- **Handling Permission States**: I gained insights into managing permission states and responding to user actions in a Compose-based UI.
- **Integrating Permissions with Compose UI**: I explored how to seamlessly integrate Android's permission system with the declarative UI model of Jetpack Compose, ensuring a smooth user experience.
